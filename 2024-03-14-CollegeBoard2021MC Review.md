                Explanation: This code segment assigns the value of the last element of the list to the variable temp, then removes the last element of the list, then appends temp to the end of the list. The resulting list is the same as the original list.

                Explanation: When input1 and input2 are both true, the expressions (NOT input1) and (NOT input2) are both false, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to false. In all other cases, either (NOT input1) or (NOT input2) (or both) will evaluate to true, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to true.

                Explanation: Since hot is true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since hot AND humid evaluates to false, false is displayed.

                Explanation: The code segment will iterate over myList from right to left, removing each element that is equal in value to the element immediately preceding it. For this list, the code segment will remove the sixth element (10), the fourth element (20), and the second element (10). This results in the list [10, 20, 10], which still contains duplicates.
